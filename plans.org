Here are my plans for the "author" app.

Goal:

I want to easily add (and edit?) data entries to the verseline.

A data entry consists of:

- start (verse id)
- end (verse id)
- title
- place?
- date?
- description

Do I want a distinction between a "place" item, a "date" item, and
just a regular item?

- for years, that can easily fit within the present paradigm. just
  have the description be the year.
- for places ... same idea. The long description can be the "index" entry.

In order to easily select start and end verse IDs, it would be awesome
to have a fully navigable scripture interface, including a reference
lookup.

Things I need:

- listing of available lanes
- listing? adding / editing? of items
- scripture display

Ok defs going with angular atm.
